** A Portfolio with custom CSS and vanilla Javascript **

This portfolio didn't take long to build, but was incredibly fun. It was inspired by a style I had seen used by another developer, but adding the functionality of different colour themes really made it a great little project.

The loader I added later, as that was another vanilla JS and CSS creation I had decided to work on.
